The Strathclyde Haskell Enhancement (SHE) is a somewhat inglorious bodge,
equipping ghc with automatic lifting of types to kinds, pattern
synonyms, and some kit for higgledy-piggledy literate programming.

This "enhances" the upstream [Strathclyde Haskell Enhancement (SHE)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/she)
with support for "applicative-style" tuples.
